# EDU-IT learning material

**Institute of Physics and Astronomy at Aarhus University**

Repository for storing learning material for the EDU-IT project at IFA

Notebooks compiled to HTML can be found at e.g. [https://ifa-edu-it.github.io/learning-material/courses/electrodynamics/poisson-equation.html](https://ifa-edu-it.github.io/learning-material/courses/electrodynamics/poisson-equation.html).

A countinous integration service is used to compile the notebooks to HTML each time a commit is pushed to the repository. The compiled HTML files are then available using the above url pattern. NB: Only notebooks in the "courses" folder and its subdirectories are compiled.
