# learning-material

Repository for storing learning material for the EDU-IT project at IFA

Notebooks compiled to HTML can be found at e.g. [https://ifa-edu-it.github.io/learning-material/courses/electrodynamics/poisson-equation.html](https://ifa-edu-it.github.io/learning-material/courses/electrodynamics/poisson-equation.html). Later a CI will be set up to automatically compile the notebooks.
